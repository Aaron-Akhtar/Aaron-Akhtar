Hi, my name is Aaron Akhtar, I am a Java Developer with over **4 Years of Experience** who specializes in Backend Development. I've spent most of my development career creating new software and applications for IoT systems. Oh yea, I also love writing Microservices, I don't know why but I seem to enjoy creating Service-Oriented applications.

*Some of the older projects / earlier projects are archived projects from a while ago that I decided to upload for the history of my development improvement.*
